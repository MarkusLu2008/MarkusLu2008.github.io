        <h1>Managing Social Virtual Group Members <br/> for Hong Kong Youth Services using a Discord Bot</h1>
        <p>Markus is the Head Developer for this project, which serves the “6PM Cyber Youth Support Team” of the non-profit organization “St. Jame’s Settlement” in Hong Kong. 

        <h3 id="intro">1. Introduction</h3>
        
        <p>Hikikomori (hidden youth) is a serious issue in Hong Kong. According to Wong, up to 2% of Hong Kong's population might be classified as withdrawn. Paul claims that there are hidden youngsters among Hong Kong's 140,000 young people. (Durston, 2019) In addition, COVID-19 has caused Hongkongers to live in social isolation for the first time.</p>
        
        <p>Social service councils in Hong Kong like St. James' Settlement offer hidden youngsters a social forum to communicate with each other, and social workers will hold some events to motivate teenagers to be positive. 6PM Cyber Youth Support Team is a government-funded services team which conducts youth outreach through online medium. The nonprofit organisation St James Settlement‘s  social workers provide support and counselling, via both online and offline means, to at-risk and hidden youth. 6PM has a Discord server for hidden youngsters to communicate. It is a heavy task to manage a social forum; some enthusiasts develop a bot that can help social workers manage the social forum more efficiently. However, most chatbots for social service councils are not powerful. We would like to develop a Management System with Discord bot to help the administrator and social workers in SJS to manage the Discord users more easily.</p>
